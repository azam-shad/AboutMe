# Dependency Update Policy

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines and procedures for updating dependencies within our project. Regularly updating dependencies is critical to ensure security, stability, and compatibility with the latest technologies.

## Dependency Management

We use [dependency management tool/library] to handle our project dependencies. The following guidelines apply:

1. **Versioning:** Clearly specify version ranges in our dependency files to allow for flexibility while maintaining compatibility.

2. **Security Updates:** Stay informed about security updates for our project dependencies. We prioritize security updates and aim to apply them promptly.

3. **Regular Checks:** Regularly review and assess our project dependencies to identify outdated or deprecated packages.

## Update Process

1. **Check for Updates:** Regularly check for updates to our project dependencies using [specific tool or command].

2. **Evaluate Compatibility:** Before updating, evaluate the compatibility of new versions with our existing codebase. Consider checking release notes and changelogs for any breaking changes.

3. **Automated Testing:** Run automated tests to ensure that the updated dependencies do not introduce new issues or break existing functionality.

4. **Testing Environment:** If possible, test the updates in a staging environment that closely resembles our production environment.

5. **Rollback Plan:** Have a rollback plan in place in case the update causes unforeseen issues. Be prepared to revert to the previous dependency versions.

## Notification and Communication

1. **Changelogs:** Keep an eye on changelogs and release notes for dependencies to understand new features, bug fixes, and security patches.

2. **Communication:** Communicate planned dependency updates with the team through [communication channel]. Ensure everyone is aware of the changes and potential impact.

3. **Timeline:** Provide a timeline for the update process, including planned dates for testing and deployment.

## Documentation

Maintain documentation that includes:

1. **Dependency List:** A list of all dependencies used in the project, including their versions.

2. **Update Procedures:** Detailed procedures for updating dependencies, including testing and rollback instructions.

3. **Contact Information:** Contact information for team members responsible for handling dependency updates.

## Review and Revision

This Dependency Update Policy will be subject to periodic review to ensure its effectiveness. Feedback from team members is encouraged to improve and update the policy as needed.
